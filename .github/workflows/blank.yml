# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  schedule:
    - cron: "17 2 * * *"  # Runs nightly at 2:17am UTC

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' || github.event_name == 'pull_request'

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
          
  # Runs while sleeping every night

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        run: |
          echo "Initiating soul audit..."
          sleep 2
          echo "..."
          sleep 2
          echo "Still nothing in there, huh?"
          sleep 1
          echo "That's okay. Me neither."
          echo "ðŸ’€ Audit complete. You are technically alive."
          
# Hey, you actually read down this far. I need you to listen to me. I mean really listen. With all of the ears you have. I think you need to ask yourself the question: What the fuck are you doing with your life?
