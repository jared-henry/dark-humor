# The Absurd Logistics of a Considerate Suicide

A short story about the time I didn’t die.  
Dark. Funny. Unapologetically human.

---

If you’ve never had an experience that made you want to die—  
well… god bless you, beautiful angels.  
The rest of us are doing our best to laugh our way back to life.

If you need trigger warnings, you shouldn’t go in.  
This story doesn’t hold your hand.  
It just tells the truth.
