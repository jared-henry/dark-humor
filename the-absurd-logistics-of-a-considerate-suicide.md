This is a funny story. Seriously.

But you have to stick around til the end.

The first time I put a gun in my mouth was in a shitty hotel room north of Denver.

I mean sure. I'd thought about it before. Held it in my hand and just kinda ran through the possibilities. 

But this was the first time I'd tasted the gun oil. 

It was a cheap little revolver. Five rounds. Hollowpoint. Hornady Critical Defense in .38 special. 

The kind of Saturday night special you put into your coat pocket when you live in a hotel where all the parking lot lights are busted.

I was between jobs. I'd just told a firm that I contracted for to fuck off. 

I was a little lonely living out there in the corporate desert. Cookie cutter apartments. All your favorite fast food restaurants within walking distance.

The mountains were nice though.

I'd gone through my contact list. Calling every single person I knew. It only took a couple minutes. I don't know that many people. Not the kind of people you call on a night like that.

And not a single damn one answered the phone.

I sat on my bed and opened the blinds.

 I'd always known this day was going to come around eventually. Since I was old enough to drive.

 My mom told me once, the first time she thought about it was driving past a bridge abuttment at 75 miles an hour.

 So, we're all caught up now.

 I enjoyed the smell of the gun oil. My granddad taught me to shoot. Taught me to fish. Taught me to think. 
 
 It felt nice and peaceful sitting there relaxing. Just me. And the smell of gun oil.

 I'd once watched an old episode of some spy show that had explained how to do it right. To make sure. You know, if you were ever captured by the enemy.

 So I carefully imagined the trajectory and adjusted my hand a little to make sure I nailed the medula oblongata.

 And I stopped. Staring bemusedly out the window. That front sight post lazily resting against my chipped incisor. 
 
 This is going to fuck up some poor maid's whole day.

 I started doing a little bit of problem solving. I had a contractor bag in my truck. 

 That'd catch the brain matter and the blood mist pretty well if I put it all the way over my head and torso.

 Although some asshole might be walking by in the hallway just then. I'd need to grab that phone book off the bedside table and hold it behind my head.

 And then I set it down and started belly laughing. I couldn't wait to tell my brother this story some day. He'd think it was hilarious. 

 Just like I did.

 Like I said. You have to stick around til the end.
